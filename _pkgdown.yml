  tagline: "Reproducible climate and weather data tools for ecological and infectious-disease modeling."
  description: >
    Tools for archiving, validating, analyzing, and simulating weather and climate data
    for ecological and infectious-disease modeling. `climecol` streamlines reproducible
    workflows by combining curated datasets, gap-filling and QA utilities, photoperiod
    and seasonal fitting functions, and stochastic rainfall and temperature scenario
    generation â€” all designed for climate-driven ecological research.
