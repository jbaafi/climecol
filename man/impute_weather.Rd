\title{Impute missing weather values by station}
\usage{
impute_weather(
  df,
  method = c("locf", "linear", "spline"),
  cols = c("tmax_c", "tmin_c", "tavg_c", "wind_spd_kmh"),
  max_gap = Inf
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Tibble with at least \code{date} and \code{station}.}

\item{method}{One of \code{"locf"}, \code{"linear"}, \code{"spline"}.
\itemize{
\item \code{"locf"}: last observation carried forward (then backward pass).
\item \code{"linear"}: piecewise linear interpolation (via \code{approx}).
\item \code{"spline"}: cubic spline (\code{stats::spline}), smoothest; use with care.
}}

\item{cols}{Character vector of columns to impute. Default:
c("tmax_c","tmin_c","tavg_c","wind_spd_kmh").
(Precip/snow often have true zeros and bursts; include them explicitly if desired.)}

\item{max_gap}{Integer number of days. Only interpolate runs of NAs of length
<= \code{max_gap}; longer runs remain NA (applies to \code{"linear"}/\code{"spline"}).
Default Inf.}
}
\value{
Tibble like \code{df} with imputed values in \code{cols}.
}
\description{
Lightweight imputers for common weather gaps. Operates per-station and
returns the same rows/columns with imputed values in selected columns.
Defaults are conservative (temperatures + wind speed only).
